One of the treasures made by these breweries and nearly lost to history was spiced witbier (white beer).  Witbier defied an untimely fate, being revived by a man named Pierre Celis who worked in one of the last breweries in Belgium to commercially produce a version of this unique, spiced beer.  Celis eventually sold his own witbier brewery and moved to Austin, Texas to open another white beer brewery (Celis White) and the rest is history. 
​
In honor of the late and great Pierre Celis, we are proud to offer Community Wit as a warm weather libation, produced locally for our fellow Texans once again.  We brew it traditionally using unmalted wheat as our base and lightly spice the kettle with freshly ground sweet and bitter orange peel and coriander seed.  The hops are minimal, keeping the focus on the wheat, spices and the unique character contributed by authentic Belgian yeast strains, one of which originated from the same strain that Pierre brought across the Atlantic to America.",Weizen,,N,Community Witbier,1.052,3

We only brewed it once, then we decided not to do it again. It’s hard to say why, except it seemed like the right thing to do. Maybe we’ll make it again one day.

Anyway, for the sake of history, here is our description:
Confounded Mr. Sisyphus is a subtle beer, full of yeast, bacteria, leafy hops and grains. Mr. Sisyphus’s roots are Vienna-style lager malts, which give a golden orange colour and a malty nuttiness. Light esters and phenols from four strains of yeast give fragrance, and a malolactic bacteria has softened the acidity during conditioning and will continue to do so in the bottle. At his extremities you’ll find herbal German Hallertau and American Crystal hops, like leaves basking in the sun. Finally come Balaton cherries, with their spicy, musty, earthy character.


This is a beer to drink at sunset, be it in the quietness of a darkening forest or with the stillness of the city surrounding you. We even wrote Mr.S his own bedtime story…

“A gentle breeze blew through the forest. The leaves fluttered, and the ripe cherries on the Sisyphus tree bumped against one another. Then all was still. A tiny, contented sigh then came. It would only have been audible to a bird close by, or perhaps a child standing amongst the blossoms near the ground. But a sigh it was, and a most extraordinary sigh, for it came from Mr. Sisyphus.

If you stand at the bottom of the Sisyphus tree, close in beside the trunk where leaves surround you, and gaze up into its depths, you might notice that amongst all the cherries hanging there, one is not quite the same as all the others. Perhaps you will notice a tiny foot, a twig-like hand, or even, if your crane your neck, an eyeball twinkling there amongst the hanging balls of fruit. Unpluckable, never picked by hand, nor pecked by bird, nor pitted and preserved in a pie. Never to fall gently and bounce on soft moss, to be planted and grow again. For there hangs Mr. Sisyphus, the cherry who cannot fall.”",Snifter,,N,Confounded Mr. Sisyphus,1.044,11

The Greek myth of Pandora has been interpreted in many ways but one common understanding is that she is the woman who, out of curiosity, opened a box which released the evils of all mankind.  Pandora was the first woman, a gift from the gods to man. What most do not realize is that her name means “all-giving” as each god contributed to creating Pandora by giving her unique, seductive gifts. Regardless of which version of the myth you follow, you should know that her curiosity ultimately enabled one key gift to remain in the box for man for eternity – the gift of hope.

As our first gift and flagship beer, we hope Pandora  awakens your curiosity without harm and keeps the promise of hope of an amazing adventure in craft beer.

It has an ABV of 10.2% and uses the Westmalle yeast strain but all other details are speculation and the recipe is tightly guarded. The date stamped on the cap is a ""Best After"" date approximately three year after the day of production. The yellow cap is the only identifying mark of this beer as there is no label and they use three different bottles in production: plain, ""Trappisten,"" and ""Westmalle."" The beer is not distributed anywhere in the world. The only way to acquire it is to visit the monastery.

Young bottles tend to be rather boozy, yet, the alcohol is never hot or harsh. Dried, dark fruit esters come through in the nose and taste and are accompanied by intense melanoidins. The characterful Westmalle yeast contributes to a doughy aroma, low bubble gum esters (think Juicy Fruit) and a hint of black licorice.

Our Golden Lager recipe combines the finest Colorado-grown hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley from the San Luis Valley. Each brew begins with a slow and easy 90-minute boil. Select Colorado-grown hops are added to build taste complexities and balance the malt sweetness.  After fermentation, each brew is crash-cooled to 1° Celsius and allowed to rest (lager) for up to four weeks. This Chill-lagering develops each brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden-copper lager that is appreciated for its unmistakable crisp, clean finish.

Instead, according to The Beer Connoisseur, ONLINE, India Pale Ale seems to have developed out of the idea current at least as far back as the 1760s that it was “absolutely necessary” to add extra hops to beer intended to be drunk in hot climates. The Bow Brewery became the dominant shipper of the lighter style beer to India, mostly because of its close proximity to the East India Company docks on the River Thames. Lady Luck strikes again. 

The Addlehead IPA formula calls for a blending of 5 grains and 3 hops to produce a beer that IPA devotees appreciate but others also find pleasantly tasty. 

Addlehead has a golden yellow color and a full, rich body with a creamy head and a medium lace. It is rated at 95 IBU (International Bitterness Units), but it has a balanced hint of sweetness which is rare in an IPA. 

Most importantly, it retains the signature IPA hoppy finish.",,,Y,Addlehead,1.06,9

Nose: Light wood smoke, ribs, bacon, malt sweetness.
Palate: This beer drinks quite a bit lighter than it looks. A light smoke taste will greet the palate, moving into distinct malt notes of biscuit, maybe a touch of raisin. Very light bodied, this beer finishes with a tart cloying taste that dries the palate. This is essentially unsweetened honey. It coats the mouth and the smokiness will build as you progress through the pint.
Other Notes:
Smoked Honey is not a heavy tasting beer. It is also not a ""sweet"" tasting beer, and it actually finishes rather dry. What makes this beer different from traditional honey beers is that the honey is completely fermented out, leaving little residual sweetness. The lightly smoked character comes from the beechwood smoke malt we use, which has a very delicate — rather than overly aggressive — smoky taste.",,,N,SMOKED HONEY,1.04,27

7287,5.5,Available year round as a staple beer.,"In April 2013 we inked a deal with ArtPrize that made us the official brewery of the competition for the next five years. The premier leadership sponsorship deal included offering our beer at all official ArtPrize events, signage, promotion, merchandise, specialized glassware and other items. It also included permission for us to use the ArtPrize identity marks (logo and graphics) on any co-packaged items, including beer. We plan to release a new beer for each year of our five-year partnership with ArtPrize under the name “Artist Series”. This is year two. Last year’s release was Inspired Artist Black IPA.

“Making a unique beer in honor of ArtPrize has become a fun challenge for our brewers,” said Dave Engbers, our co-founder and vice president of brand and education. “This year’s release just fell into place. Ninkasi—a stained glass ArtPrize submission that showed in our taproom last year—became a permanent part of our taproom when we purchased it last year. We knew right away that it would make a perfect label for Mosaic Promise, a beautifully simple beer that we had been experimenting with for some time.”

Mosaic Promise showcases a single malt—Golden Promise—and a single hop—Mosaic. The traditional barley’s depth of flavor and the versatility of the hops’ bittering, flavor and aroma characteristics are the strong pillars that comprise the structure of this clean, rich, golden beer. We can brew complex beers with the best of them, but we recognize that there’s also beauty in simplicity. The beer clocks in at 5.5% ABV and 50 IBUs.

Proceeds from the sale of Mosaic Promise will support the future programming of the ArtPrize organization. ArtPrize is an international art competition, open to any artist and decided by public vote. Its mission is to promote critical dialogue and collaboration through new, creative ideas among a large and diverse population of people. As an innovator in redefining what beer can be, we believe that experimentation is central to the human experience—whether one experiments with grains and hops or colored glass and light—and that sharing one’s creation with the public is a brave act worth celebrating.

“Founders is an iconic brand producing a sublime range of exquisite beers in our own Grand Rapids,” said Christian Gaines, executive director of ArtPrize. “We’re honored and elated to count Founders as the ArtPrize Official Brewery and to include Mosaic Promise as the latest special release beer—one that’s emblematic of our strong partnership and shared commitment to art, artists and community.”

More than 400,000 people are expected to attend ArtPrize 2014.

We also partnered with ArtPrize to launch ArtPrize on Tap, the newest ArtClub membership perk. From the patios of the Centennial Room, our private second-floor entertainment space, ArtPrize on Tap offers ArtClub members the opportunity to connect year-round and stay on the ArtPrize insider track, while enjoying Founders food and beer. We will premiere Mosaic Promise at the August installment of ArtPrize on Tap. Held on the third Wednesday of every month, ArtPrize on Tap is free for ArtClub members, and friends of ArtPrize and Founders can join for $10. To learn more, go to artprize.org/artclub.

Mosaic Promise will be available for a limited time starting on Sunday, September 14, across our Michigan, Wisconsin, metro NYC and Chicagoland distribution footprint. It will be released in our taproom on draft and in bottles starting on Tuesday, September 16. There will be an event in our taproom featuring the artists and introducing the beer from 4:30-6:30pm that day. One-of-a-kind Mosaic Promise posters will be given away, while supplies last. Mosaic Promise will also be featured at official ArtPrize events.

But on the third day, the sun broke through and everything was glorious! The name Snow Day evoked joyful freedom. Everyone remembers waiting for the school report as little kids. When you heard your school was closed, you suddenly had all day to play in the transformed, white landscape. Well, that’s the kind of emotion we put into this beer.

The vessel, made of birch bark, was found in the tomb of a leather‐clad woman Dr. Pat says was probably an upper-class dancer or priestess. The analysis pointed to the ingredients used in this unique brew: wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, myrica gale, yarrow, honey and birch syrup.

The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness. While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs.",Snifter,,N,Kvasir,1.03,17

After fermentation, we aged #54 on Ghanaian vanilla beans and medium roast Ghanaian cocoa nibs for ten days.   The malt has a slight roast but is designed with a lighter body to let the cocoa flavors show through. The addition of lactose gives a smooth mouthfeel.

Barley malt and wheat help create a smooth body and attribute a pleasant golden hue while the addition of malted rye and oats brings out a solid earthy flavor. Czech Saaz Hops help create a citrus nose.

What makes this beer truly special is the Saison Ale yeast strain used to ferment this beer. The subtle hints of tangerine, peach and licorice are the hallmarks of this particular yeast.

Booyah is a farmhouse ale, which means it’s a kitchen sink type of recipe, so there are no rules when it comes to grain bill, hops or yeast. When it comes to grain, just name it, barley, oats, wheat, rye and corn. The rye malt and oats produce a really earthy smell in the mash. For this ale we use a specific saison ale strain. This yeast has been cultured to produce a lot of fruity and spicy esters, such as apricot, clove, banana and anise. Keeping the a fermentation temperature at 68 degrees controls the ester of the yeast strain. This yeast strain also likes to take its’ time, a long and slow fermentation settles out the finished beer. This is a good sippin’ beer for me. I enjoy a glass when all the work of the day is done. The complexity of this beer re-energizes me.

This is a great seasonal beer that we released in the spring the last two years. Originally we became enamored by a home brew produced by Nick Van Court, at the time a part of our brewery team.

For unknown reasons, Captain Meriweather Lewis purchased a large black Newfoundland dog for the grand sum of $20 to his companion during the Expedition of the Corps of Discovery. He named the faithful pooch, Seaman, but a early transcription error of his journal dubbed the dog Scannon (we prefer this name). Scannon accompanied the Expedition for its duration, even though over 200 other dogs were eaten as dinner during the journey. Scannon survived a vicious beaver attack in 1805, in which the rodent’s incisors sliced an artery in his leg. He was also stolen by Native Americans on one occasion and retrieved.

The Beer:
The Scannon Stout is an oatmeal stout that is both strong and approachable. With its dark color, the Scannon Stout has a nose of roasted notes and flavors of chocolate and roast. There is a subtle, residual sweetness due to the flaked oatmeal. This additional grain also lends a smooth, silky mouthfeel that has to be experienced.",,,N,Scannon Stout,1.038,20

 Mudflats are coastal wetlands that form when mud and silt are brought in by seas, oceans and tributaries. When the tide comes in, water mixes with the mud and silt, creating the muddy quicksand that occurs in mudflats.

With quiet ferocity, how quickly this force erases the sensations and reduces any creature to its most basic elements. When enveloped in one, sight, sound and even tactile sensation are ripped away, as snowflakes in motion swallow all sense of being, leaving one to cower, hunker down and wait it out, hoping that it passes quickly or that the end is merciful. Of variable and unknown duration minutes seem like eternity in a whiteout.

But when it eases, and those final snowflakes drift in the blue sky, any survivor is changed. Suddenly, life is fuller and more robust. The thirst for this new life can be slaked in many ways. Whiteout Wit compliments the experience in both intensity and a rewarding calm. The quiet delicacy of the light malts are like those vanishing flakes. Sorachi Ace hops contribute the lemony aroma and flavor, imparting additional life to the brew, reminding you of how good it is to be alive. Lemon peel, Indian coriander and black peppercorns add the same invigorating zest whiteout survivors feel when stepping from the world of white. Triple fermentation, the long slumber in French Chardonnay barrels and a shot of brettanomyces provide an explosion of flavor when combined with the other swirling, enticing elements. It's okay.

The ale fermentation imparts a background tropical fruit note reminiscent of mangos and peaches.  All of these flavors come together to create a thirst quenching, clean finishing beer perfect for those warm summer days.",Pint,,N,Samuel Adams Summer Ale,1.0497,6

8420,5.3,Available during the fall months.,"Dancing Trout Ale is a German Wheat Ale, the filtered version of a true Bavarian Hefeweizen. In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana’s trout habitat, one beer at a time. 

 To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing’s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. 

 Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale — the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.",,,N,Dancing Trout Ale,1.028,4

Scientific Description
A Beer based off of Pi (π). Here’s how we incorporate the value:
•Alcohol is 3.14% by weight (π) or 4% by volume. 
•All specialty malts are based on a 3.14% (π). Some specialty malts are just 3.14% (π) or a multiplier of it. 
•The Hops are in interesting ingredient. We only add hops in increments of 3.14lbs (π). But since the alpha acid changes (how much bitterness each hop has) we change the times at which the hops are added, not the weight as would be normal in most brews. 
•Mash Temp = π squared x ABV squared.",Pint,,N,Pi 3.14 Golden Ale,1.045,7

The brewing was later moved to the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field. In February of 2012, Barmen production was moved back to AC Golden Brewing Company in order to make room for more Blue Moon innovations at the Sandlot Brewery.

Barmen was born of Pete Coors’ desire to brew a German Pilsner that tastes exactly like the great pilsners of northern Germany. The beer was named after Barmen, Germany; birthplace of Adolph Herman Joseph Coors. Barmen is offered in only a few bars and restaurants in and around Golden, CO.
 
To ensure you enjoy the full Barmen experience, bars and restaurants offering Barmen are requested to honor the traditional “German Seven-Minute Pour” and to serve the beer in the proper Barmen branded pilsner glass. When properly poured, it should look like this. Feel empowered to send the beer back to the bartender if it isn’t served correctly.

This Pilsner pours a golden straw color, with a beautiful cap of fluffy white foam that creates a “lace” on the sides of the glass as the beer is drank.

What we do know is that the ember grew into a flame and once released, grew legs, antlers and much more...A legend was born.

In a small office, not far away, a community festival struggled. After staggering debt was paid off thanks to community support, it was time to give Rondy back to the people. Time to bring it back to its Alaskan roots and reengage the vast majority of the community that had walked away from it.

Bob & Mark brought up the idea for an event so out there, so uniquely Alaskan that it was destined for success. All it needed was someone (enter Susan Duck, Rondy's Executive Director) to round up some reindeer, a little planning and insurance... insurance that took nine months to find. Finally, the last company on the list, agreed to insure the event.
At that moment, the legendary Rondy Running of the Reindeer was born. Born of a trinity of minds just twisted enough to see the potential joy it could bring to all on hand. Bob & Mark added in the United States Marine Corps Toys for Tots as their benficiary and to date we have raised over $30,000 for them.

Susan added in the costume element when she relayed to the registrants a challenge from one ""Margy J."", who ""challenged everyone to show the world how Alaskans Run with the Reindeer - boas, sequins, etc."". The gauntlet hit with a resounding thud and the costumes came out in force!

In 2012, Bob, Mark, KWHL 106.5 along with Susan and the Board of Directors and Staff of Greater Anchorage Inc. invite you to celebrate the 5th Anniversary of the Running of the Reindeer! We'll see you March 3rd at 4pm on 4th Avenue!",,,N,Rondy Brew,1.055,6
8556,6.3,Available year round as a staple beer.,"Everyone in this part of the world is familiar with the legend of the Chupacabra, but only recently have reports of the Hopadillo begun to emerge.  Driven to the edge of extinction by the decades long practice of American brewers putting as few hops as possible in their beer, the Hopadillo has begun to thrive again now that craft brewers like Karbach Brewing Company are generously hopping their beers.  You see, the Hopadillo needs a certain compound found only in hops in order to survive.   Of course, you’re thinking that the Hopadillo should simply live in the major hop growing regions of the world. Problem is this compound the Hopadillo needs must be in a metabolized form found only in humans after they have consumed highly hopped beer. 

So why has the Hopadillo been spotted more in Texas than in other parts of the US where the resurgence of well hopped beers has been underway for years now?  For one, Hopadillos seem to prefer a warmer climate.  They also seem to like when a variety of American and European hops are used in the process.  Rumor has it that is exactly what the boys down at Karbach are doing.  Despite the fact that one of Karbach’s employees disappeared one night after having a couple of the IPAs after work, they continue to brew this beer, undeterred by the traces of the employee’s DNA from an “unidentifiable” organism found in the brewery parking lot.",Pint,,N,Hopadillo  IPA,1.066,11

9021,5.5,Limited availability.,"In 1859, Alfred Brown Peticolas opened the first Peticolas law firm in the State of Texas. After briefly leaving his practice to fight in the Civil War, A.B. returned to the practice of law in 1866. Since that time, A.B., his son (Warner Marion), grandson (William Craig), great grandson (Edward Kent), and/or great-great grandson ( Michael) have continuously practiced law in the State of Texas. 

 Named after Alfred Brown Peticolas, our English brown ale is a dialed back version of the American interpretation. It’s copper in color with a pleasantly light hop aroma, which is balanced with a delicate roasty maltiness. Notes of nut and chocolate are subdued, but clearly present in flavor. This beer’s body is medium-light and possesses a smooth texture with a hint of residual sweetness. 

 The roasted characteristics of this beer make it the perfect match for any meats or vegetables prepared on the grill.

 A little more on A.B. Peticolas? He was born in Richmond, Virginia, on May 27, 1838. As a young man, he studied law and taught school. He began his practice in Virginia, but ultimately moved west to Victoria, Texas. In 1859, he opened up a law practice with Samuel A. White. A.B. Peticolas may be best remembered today for his published Civil War journals and detailed pencil sketches, having served during the Sibley Campaign in New Mexico with Co. C., 4th Regiment, Texas Mounted Volunteers. After his discharge in 1865, he returned to Victoria to practice law. In 1894, A.B. Peticolas authored an index-digest to all civil cases contained in the Texas Report. This catalog became standard text of the Texas Bar Association for years. In his later years, A.B. Peticolas was known simply as the “Judge.”",,,N,Alfred Brown,1.04,24

Truly a craft beer, the recipe was first brewed by Jeff as a 10-gallon batch of homebrew. Of all his homebrew recipes, Jeff chose Tallgrass Ale as the flagship beer because of the beer’s surprising light body, extraordinarily smooth and balanced profile, great taste, and clean finish. The first time Jeff brewed Tallgrass Ale he thought it looked a little too dark, but after he kegged that first batch, the finished beer was really, really tasty! That first little 10-gallon batch of Tallgrass was gone way too fast!

The beer was different from anything he or his friends could find on tap or on the shelf. It was a beer that was a deep chestnut color, yet had a great flavor and was so light tasting that it kept you wanting more. The distinctive look and taste of Tallgrass Ale comes from our unique blend of German, English, and American-style malts and a generous helping of both American and traditional English hops.

We all know of his powers over thunder and lightning, but there is a story in the Poetic Edda that we feel is much more appropriate.  As the tale goes, Thor woke one morning to find his hammer, Mjolnir, missing.  With the assistance of Loki, Thor quickly discovered that his hammer had been stolen by Thrym, the king of a race of Giants, and that his only means of retrieval of Mjolnir, was to have Freya agree to become Thrym’s wife.  Now while Freya was promiscuous, even she had her standards, and after refusing to take part in the exchange, Thor dressed in a bridal gown and veil and presented himself in the role of Freya.  Thrym bought in to the ruse, and upon presenting Mjolnir to Freya (secretly Thor) in the exchange, Thor threw off the veil and gown and destroyed the Giants en masse.  I guess what we are trying to say, is that behind our beer’s thinly veiled and beautiful facade, lay a full bodied ale that can pack a punch!

His mind expands as he strolls and peruses the masterpieces before him.

What better artist to settle on but one whose vision evoked the same response from great masters such as Matisse and Picasso, who remarked that Paul Cézanne “is the father of us all”.  Still life artwork was prevalent in this French Post-Impressionist painter’s repertoire.

Bayern's Hefeweizen is hopped moderately with Hallertauer Perle from Germany, has an alcohol content of 5.4% Alcohol by Volume (13.1% Plato o.g.) and is made using malted wheat, pale and caramel malt. The hefeweizen beer style was invented in Bavaria and Bayern Brewing's version is one of the very few that is actually brewed as it is in Bavaria by a Bavarian Brewmaster. So if you are interested in this style of beer, try this one first and see how the other ones compare to the original. 

 St. Wilbur Weizen is brewed using the recipe of the old Brauerei zum Schiff brewery in Kaufbeuren, Germany, which is located 60 miles southwest of Munich and was established in 1540. Jürgen Knöller, the owner of Bayern Brewing, apprenticed in this brewery from 1978 to 1981 and brought this original recipe to Missoula in 1987. 

 In 2002, Jürgen decided to rename Bayern's Hefeweizen ""St Wilbur Weizen"" after his beloved St. Bernard, Wilbur, who had been adopted from the Humane Society. Sympathetic with the issues of these large breed dogs, Bayern now donates a portion of sales of this beer style and all affiliated merchandise to the Saint Bernard Rescue Foundation. To learn more about this, please read this edition of our Brewsletter. Whenever you think about Wilbur, just remember this: HE MAY BE A SAINT, BUT HE'S NO ANGEL!",,,Y,St. Wilbur Weizen,1.053,5

Keith has an obvious passion for brewing beer. That goes without saying. But he also has a little-known passion for wine-making. In 1995, while he was crushing grapes and thinking back to his travels through California and French wine country, the idea of blending a beer with a wine popped into his head. Intrigued, he had to give it a shot.

He started by using the juice of Chardonnay grapes to give the beer a crisp, light quality, very much like a glass of Chardonnay. He then used white wheat as the only grain to create a clean, smooth finish that could not be achieved with other malts. After cellar-aging the batch for a couple of months, he tasted his latest work. He was pleasantly surprised with the clarity and refreshing taste.

In 2006, with wine and Craft beer growing in popularity with drinkers, he decided it would be a good time to bring it back. After a couple of years at festivals and special events, it started to gain a following. Then in 2010, it just happened to take home a gold medal from the Great American Beer Festival®.

He is usually pictured as an old, long-haired and one-eyed wiseman, as legend holds that he sacrificed one of his eyes in order to drink from the fountain of all knowledge and wisdom.

More relevant to us however, Odin once transformed himself into an eagle and flew in to the land of men.  Sprinkling “magic dust” on some clay vessels that were storing the grain harvest from that year, this “magic dust,” along with some water transformed the grain into the first beer.  Hence, Odin gave the “Gift” of fermentation to mankind.  Our beer is a tribute to this rich and complex mythology and a ‘Thank you’ for his gift.

The Rock is a story unique to Milwaukee and our freshwater coast. As part of the drinking water system for the city, the system draws from a big pipe in the Lake. The “intake” was marked by a big structure that was prominent off the Bradford Beach shoreline. Because of the privacy (in plain view!)the Rock was a popular lookout point for ambitious suitors. In the exciting free love days of the early ’70′s, a few ambitious Milwaukeeans paddled out to the Rock and memorialized the sentiment of the time.

The original version of Love Rock known as “Winter Lager” happens to be the second batch of beer brewer at our second street location, it was brewed on November 27th 2007. We have made a few adjustments to the recipe over the years, just to the body and to the color. The Love Rock is Milwaukee Brewing’s first year round production lager. The cold, long fermentation process that helps create such a smooth flavor. This recipe is pretty straight forward with the malts and two hop varieties. The Vienna style malt adds a nice toasty quality without overwhelming the beer. Our yeast guy tells us that this lager strain happens to be quite old. Many of the the major breweries in Milwaukee did, and still do, use this yeast. Love Rock is a refreshing and simple beer.",Pilsner,,N,Love Rock,1.051,13

Using only Pilsner, Munich and Vienna malts this lager has a huge fresh toasted bread aroma with the slightest spice from some of Europe’s finest hops.

These two ranges are home to some of Colorado’s highest mountains, known as ‘fourteeners’ as their altitude is above fourteen thousand feet—there are many within a short distance from Aspen, but one of the most breathtaking to behold is surely Pyramid Peak. Impressive aesthetically, Pyramid and its neighbors the Maroon Bells are also some of the most difficult fourteeners to climb. We couldn’t help but name a badass beer after this badass mountain.

10448,5.9,Available year round as a staple beer.,"When Martha and I began thinking about what type of beer to brew next for PRETTY THINGS, there was no discussion.  In fact we’ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.
Many people know that Martha and I love Theakston’s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson’s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called “Morocco Ale”  that is quite similar as well.

Obviously PRETTY THINGS isn’t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don’t do beer “styles” straight up, as it doesn’t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.

“Rustic Dark Ale”, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph’s Town (we almost used “New World Stingo” but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!

As we did in Jack D’Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We “chaptalized” using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.

SBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it’s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it’s about the flavour, not just ticking the “style” boxes.

In the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We’ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!

The name “Saint Botolph’s Town” is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of “Botolph’s Town” or “Botolph’s Stone”. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a ‘stump’ (broken old cross) marks the spot.  Saint Botolph is a 7th century saint from England whose feast day is June 17th.  Perhaps a great day to save a bottle or two for!",,,N,St. Botolph's Town,1.04,18

However, it is generally accepted that citrus fruits were first cultivated in Sicily during the Arab period, in the ninth and tenth centuries.

The modern English word orange, like the Italian arancia, probably derives from the Arabic naranj. Oranges are native to tropical Asia, particularly the Malay region.

Cultivation of oranges gradually spread through China and India to east Africa and then to the Mediterranean region. The trees enjoy a mild climate, sunny weather and good drainage. An occasional frost or chill does not harm them.

Blood oranges are so called for their red flesh and deep red juice. When ripe, their skin may also be reddish, at least in part. In the British Empire, blood oranges were called ""Maltese"" oranges, and are closely related to Jaffa oranges. In Sicily, the most popular blood oranges are the Tarocco, the Moro and the Sanguigno, the latter cultivated extensively in the western part of the island as the Sanguinello of Paternò and Adernò. Though consumed in salads and desserts, blood oranges are favored for their distinctive red juice which, as it happens, is exceptionally healthy, being rich in antioxidants.

The blood orange is considered particularly Sicilian, perhaps because it is not as widely cultivated in Calabria, Spain or Greece. It is worth mentioning that, as regards citrus fruits generally, Italy is one of the world's largest producers of lemons, most of which are harvested in Sicily. It was this citrus production that earned the hills and valleys around Palermo the name ""Conca d'Oro"" (golden seashell) in the Middle Ages.",,,N,Barley's Blood Thirst Wheat,1.048,6

 This pale golden ale is slightly sweet, lightly hopped, smooth, crisp and refreshing. A subdued hop aroma and just the lightest hint of fruityness round out a delicate and crisp, yet surprisingly complex, blonde style ale. At only 4¾% alcohol by volume, it’s very sessionable. Also, being delicate and crisp means it won’t weigh you down with mouth chewing maltyness, or wreck your tongue with an onslaught of bitter hops.

Wait, wait… What do we mean by “sessionable”? Glad you asked!

A session beer is one with a moderate alcohol level of between 4% and 5½%. In other words, just enough alcohol to get you buzzed but not so much that you’ll be flat on your back after enjoying two of ‘em.
