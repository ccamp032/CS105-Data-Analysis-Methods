105,5.4,Available year round as a staple beer.,"Persephone (pronounced pur-SEF-uh-nee), the beautiful Goddess of Spring’s bounty, was long considered to be among the purest of all Olympians. One day, while gathering flowers in a field, Persephone was abducted by Hades, who whisked her away to the Underworld to be his Queen. Persephone’s mother, Goddess of the Harvest, was understandably despondent, wandering the Earth in search of her daughter. During that time, warmth disappeared, crops withered, and the land fell into a perpetual winter.

At some length, Hades was persuaded to surrender Persephone for one-half of every year –  the Spring and Summer seasons – so that flowers could bloom and the earth might bear fruit once more. To this day, the half-year that Persephone spends every twelve months in the Underworld inevitably hearkens the return of a cold and barren period.

At Legion Brewing, we just weren’t ready to capitulate to six months of frosty temperatures every year – we live in The South, you know! So we decided to do something about it: Hang on to the warmth of the seasons by brewing a Saison all year long… In tribute, we’re calling her ‘Persephone.’ (Saison – 5.4% ABV, 26 IBUs)

We believe that having a Saison on tap throughout the year will remind our customers of what they love about the warmer seasons. Even better, during Harvest periods – when fruits and berries are plentiful in our region – we’ll infuse Persephone with local flavors. We’re pretty sure Persephone’s Mom (the Goddess of grain, agriculture and fertility) would approve…",,26.0,N,Persephone,1.055,7

In accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law of 1516), bock beers must have a pre-fermentation malt sugar concentration of 16%, which converts over to at least 7% alcohol after fermentation. These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods.

Our focus was on both the malts and hops used during the brewing process.

Thus our Barley Wine has a very rich, intense, and heavy body, the aroma and flavor of rye grain is very prominent . Our version is also very heavily hopped with a finishing IBU of 130 before barreling, thus balancing the sweetness of the body.

Nose: Light citrus, and floral hop character
Palate: Restrained Cascade and Chinook hop tastes greet the palate with hints of citrus and pine. This yields to a subtle yet balanced malt character and finishes with a mild, yet present bitterness that lingers on the palate.
Other Notes: 
This beer is not a ""hop bomb"". It is intended to be a refreshing, halfway point between the malt of an English Pale, and the wild hopping of a west coast pale ale, or American IPA. There is hop present, there is a lingering bitterness, but this beer won't destroy your palate for weeks to come, and leave you unable to dream. Dry-hopping refers to the process of how the last hops are added to the beer, not to the form or type of hop itself.

This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern’s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of  17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.
 The formulation for this delicate beer came from the Brauerei zum Schiff in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. Bayern Brewing’s proprietor, Jürgen Knöller, was one of the last of five brewers that brewed this special beer in 1979 before the brewery, which was founded in 1540, sadly closed its doors due to the owner’s passing. 
 In fall of 2007, when it became apparent that the crisis of extremely high raw material prices would continue, the Bayern team decided to test the market with a brew that uses a very large amount of energy and raw materials while being the most difficult, labor-intensive, demanding beer that anyone could create. We told our distributors that we would do two brews at 1000 gallons each to see whether the market could handle the premium price that we had to charge due to these factors. 
 Our ""Super Brew"" lasted only a couple of months and then completely sold out. 
 So Bayern Brewing continues to brew Face Plant while its popularity continues to grow. Thus Doppelweizen has been revived here in Missoula, Montana, USA.

Brooklyn Pennant Ale is brewed from Scottish Maris Otter malt, which is justly prized for its toasty, biscuity flavor and the round smoothness it imparts to beer. Our house ale yeast brings out an appetizing fruitiness and ferments to a dry finish.

1231,6.4,Available year round as a staple beer.,"“Jack D’Or” is a simple table beer, or “Saison Americain” as we’re referring to it. We are not trying to coin a beer style – we’re just having fun.  The Jack D’Or (pronounced “Jack Door”), is at the very center of Pretty Things and nearly three years on we’re still pleased as punch that he joined us!

As you know, PRETTY THINGS doesn’t brew “styles” per se.  Close, but we re-imagine everything and leave the style numbers in books on the shelves where they belong.  What that means is that while other people might be able to put our beers into a category, we have a hard time with it! Our beers are first and foremost creative beasts, not “types” of beer. Jack D’Or is the kind of beer Martha and Dann like to drink before, after and during a great meal. Heck, we’ll drink this sort of beer any time.

On Dann & Martha’s honeymoon in France and Belgium they stashed quite a few cases of Wallonian beer into their trunk. Every night after setting up their tent they’d cook lardons and lentils on a camp stove and enjoy fresh “saison” under the stars.

Inspired by some of our favorites like Saison DuPont, but also DeRanke’s XX Bitter, De Dolle’s Arabier, and local IPAs like Smuttynose, the Jack D’Or starts off with North American Pils, Vienna, Wheat and Malted Oats (among others) and is hopped with a combination of four hops, finishing with Palisade and Nugget. The bitterness is the real backbone of the Jack D’Or.  It’s a proper “plant-like” bitterness with all of its jagged edges, beginning deep in the soil, then to the stem of this beer and up into to the very tippity heights.  Fermentation-wise we use a blend of four yeast strains to give Jack D’Or its refreshingly dry character.  Finally, despite all of the spicy flavours in this beer it contains no actual spices – only malt, oats, rye, sugar, hops and yeast.  One more time: there are no spices or citrus in Jack D’Or. Wheat lends acidity at Jack’s edges, then rye and our blended yeast character come into play for a bit of polyphony, displeasing the notion of “balance” and creating the fire in the belly of Jack D’Or!

The creature on the label is Jack D’Or himself, conceived and drawn by Dann. Far away in a small clearing in the woods of New England, ankle deep in the mash tun, he contemplates and conjures himself into a batch of beer. For those of you who are new to this, Jack is a grain of malted barley, but more than that: he is the unifying force behind all of the Pretty Things. Jack D’Or Must Die!",Oversized Wine Glass,57.0,N,Jack D'Or,1.055,5
1232,5.0,Available year round as a staple beer.,"Before the 1700's, Malting Barley was a hand-crafted, boutique process that produced inconsistent results. With the introduction of coke-fired kilns, Maltsters improved their control of the process to the point that light-colored or 'Pale' malts were now possible. These new products caught on in a big way, spawning new styles of beer including Porter, Mild, and Pale Ale. In England, the Pale Ale style was divided into several sub-styles including Extra Special Bitter, a classification typically reserved for Pale Ales brewed at over 4.8% ABV. 

Although Clandestine's 'Broken Bitters' checks in at around 5% ABV- putting it squarely in the strongest Bitter category- we think that it still qualifies as a 'Session Ale.' Well-hopped with the quintessential English partnership of East Kent Goldings and Fuggles, 'Broken Bitters' remains highly drinkable and refreshing.

Complex, with a rich malty sweetness, fruity esters and significant alcohol with moderate spiciness.

The malt is rich and forward, with caramel and toast aroma. The esters give raisin, plum and dried cherry notes, with a subtle pepperiness.

This is not a Belgian that's going to get all clove and banana on you. The Belgian yeast strain we used gives us the fruity esters we were looking for, as well as the higher alcohol.

So what's a Grand Cru?

Historically, Grand cru is a regional wine classification that designates a vineyard known for its favorable reputation. The term is not technically a classification of wine quality per se, but is intended to indicate the potential of the vineyard.

At one time, Belgium was a part of Burgundy. Elder Belgians will tell you that their love of great food and drink has its origins in the time when they were part of Burgundy.

Belgium of course has a great tradition of brewing fantastic ales. It's only natural that they would adopt this wine term to describe their best beers.

Hops have an antibiotic effect that acts against bacterial strains while leaving brewer's yeast relatively unaffected. As a result, IPA has lots of hops.

The Winter Beast scrambles and leaps on the high mountain crags. Mountain Goats with unfathomable daring, they gracefully combine sure-footedness and fearlessness.

The Beer:
The Winter Beast Doppelbock is brewed in the classic German-style. The style initially brewed in the 14th century by German brewers in Einbeck, and later brewed by Munich brewers starting in the 1600s. Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced “Einbeck” as “ein Bock” or in English “goat“. That’s how the Goat Lager or Bock got.

1881,7.2,Available year round as a staple beer.,"Most Brooklyn beers are made with a blend of hop varietals. As a chef does with spices, we look to get the best qualities of each hop and create a harmony of flavors and aromas. However, a few years ago, our brewmaster ran into a hop unique enough to deserve its own moment in the sun. A large Japanese brewery first developed the hop variety “Sorachi Ace” in 1988. A cross between the British “Brewer’s Gold” and the Czech “Saaz” varieties, it exhibited a quality that was unexpected – it smelled really lemony.
The unique flavor of Sorachi Ace was bypassed by the big brewers, but we thought it was pretty cool. So we made a special beer with it, and added the beer to our Brewmaster’s Reserve special draft beer program last year. Most Brewmaster’s Reserve beers are only available for a short time, and then they’re gone. But we liked this one so much, we decided to bring it back and give it the star treatment. Brooklyn Sorachi Ace is a classic saison, a cracklingly dry, hoppy unfiltered golden farmhouse ale, but made entirely with now-rare Sorachi Ace hops grown by a single farm in Washington. We ferment it with our special Belgian ale strain, and then add more Sorachi Ace hops post-fermentation. After the dry-hopping, the beer emerges with a bright spicy lemongrass / lemon zest aroma backed by a wonderfully clean malt flavor.

Soft Parade was originally developed because Joe Short wanted to create a beer that incorporated a medley of berries, had a great color, and appealed to wine drinkers.

The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again.

Mission Accomplished is an American IPA, brewed with a bold hop aroma and assertive bitterness. The combination of organic American and New Zealand hops give the beer sweet, juicy notes of tangerine, tropical fruit and pine. Bready malts provide some backbone but ultimately are no match for the smooth hop bitterness. The American yeast supplies mild, fruity esters that ease back and allow the hops to take their rightful place in the spotlight.
History & Style

The India Pale Ale (IPA) style was first brewed in England. Pale, assertively hopped and strong, over time the style became malty and weaker in alcohol. Early American craft brewers reinvented the IPA using American hop varieties, which gave the style its bold signature citrus and pine aroma.

Tasting Notes

Aromas of tangerine and pine hit the nose first, and then are joined by a spicy and floral hop bouquet, mingled with tropical fruit. The taste is of sweet, juicy hops with flavours of citrus and pine, followed by a smooth bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Bready malts provide just enough balance to make this IPA thoroughly enjoyable sip after sip.",,65.0,N,Mission Accomplished,1.059,13

He suffered terribly from indigestion because of his mother’s home cooking, esp. her extremely spicy chicken curries that he was forced to eat several times a week. Some historians maintain that the whole business of founding a herring meal factory was just an excuse to get away from his mother’s pots and pans. There is a legend saying that Didrik posted himself in the bow of the clipper carrying him away from his beloved hometown, and exclaimed ""No more rice and curry for this fair Dane!"" But the story has a happy end. Thanks to the fine lager brewed locally in Tranquebar, Didrik’s indigestion was cured, and in fact he soon established his own brewery out there, creating a beer so tasty that rumors of it flew all the way back to Denmark. Perhaps the herring meal was the secret ingredient that distinguished Didrik’s brew from all others. Anyhow, soon clippers carrying nothing but barrels of his product were leaving Tranquebar for Copenhagen every day of the week. Thus the Indian Pale Lager was born.

“Citrus” is certainly not our only IPA... but it was our first, and we wanted to make a statement. We at Funk Brewing Company believe in balance, complexity, and artistic brewing instead of “extreme beers”. That’s why we sought out to synthesize a beer that was masterfully crafted to accentuate a massive American Citrus hop profile while retaining our standards for balance, and sophistication.

Through various test batches, water profile manipulation, and uncommon hopping techniques, we found a way to offer you what we feel is the epitome of the American Citrus hop in a glass.
The utilization of Citra, Simcoe, Mosaic, and an experimental hop we like to call “LemonBomb”, give “Citrus” huge flavors and aromas of grapefruit, blood orange, pine, passionfruit, mango, and pink guava, balanced by a clean malt bill of Belgium’s finest pilsner malt and our neutral American yeast.

Complex and contemplative, and with well-integrated alcohol warmth, The Bottle Imp is best served in a snifter, sipped slowly and savoured.
History & Style

Beau’s Pro-Am Series is a salute to homebrewers, true innovators of our craft. These beers are designed by amateur brewers, and brewed at Beau’s. The Bottle Imp was brewed in collaboration with David Thompson, winner of the 2012 Toronto Beer Week Homebrew Contest.

The Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court.

The Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one’s heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire.

Tasting Notes

The Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice. It is well-hopped to provide balance to the malts, keeping the residual sweetness in check. The coffee character is fully integrated, and a complement to the roast of the malts. The experience is rich and intense, with gentle alcohol warmth, and a long, complex finish.
The coffee infused into The Bottle Imp are a Mexican dark roast from Chiapas region (chocolate malt, toasted spice flavours) and a medium-roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (floral, berries, tropical fruit flavours), both roasted by Bridgehead in Ottawa.",,81.0,N,The Bottle Imp,1.088,27

High carbonation gives it a strong effervescence and contributes to its refreshing quality. A low hop profile allows for the other flavors to come through and provides minimal bitterness.

History & Style

Centuries ago it would have seemed odd to consider using only one herb to spice beer. Dozens of plants, such as bog myrtle, yarrow, heather, and juniper were commonly used in ancient brewing. These beers were known as Gruit or Grut (German for herb), and a brewers’ spice blend was a proprietary and carefully guarded secret. After the Reinheitsgebot (Bavarian Purity Act of 1516) ordered that only hops be used to spice beer, the Bavarian style of brewing took hold in most of Europe, and the gruit gradually faded into obscurity. Luckily, some craft breweries have rediscovered this ancient form of brewing. Craft brewing is all about discovery and experimentation, and gruits are one of the best examples of this pioneering spirit!",,11.0,N,St. Luke’s Verse,1.056,15

Dark amber-brown in color, this brew is coarse filtered, leaving a notable haze and offering a dense, white rocky head.

Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen is brewed with authentic Bavarian wheat beer yeast, which imparts a wide spectrum of flavors and aromas from spicy clove and nutmeg to tropical fruit and banana. This traditional yeast is rarely used by American brewers so the flavors it creates are often unfamiliar, even to craft beer drinkers.  The yeast character is complemented by the taste of the malted wheat that adds a cereal note.

In our travels to Belgium we fell in love with the complex character of their distinctive yeasts with their spicy and fruity quality.  This wasn’t an obvious fit with the hop character of an IPA but we had to give it a shot.  The trick was in finding the balance of these flavors.

Yes, we damn well know our stuff here at Stone, and it would be irresponsible of us not to acknowledge how remarkable this heavenly creation of ours is. Thus the name we are compelled to give it --- Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale --- serves as a reminder of just how good we are, in both liquid and verbal form.

Other folks with great taste loved it too, but we were focused on how much we liked it, and we felt it was truly sublime.

The outcome is a smooth, flavorful summer pale ale made with 100% Organic malted barley.

Those Organic malts also impart a flavorsome yet summery smooth sweetness that quenches your thirst at the same time as tantalizing your taste buds. The upfront hop bitterness of Copper Moon is relatively low, complementing the malts nicely without being overpowering. The hop flavor and aroma are another matter, as the Centennial hops used in the latter stages of each batch intermingle delightfully to generate a dazzling citrusy, flowery and slightly spicy olfactory experience.

Silverspot IPA holds a permanent slot in the Pelican lineup with its brilliant gold color and assertively complex hop aroma. Brew Master Darron Welch selected the blend of Sterling, Fuggle and Meridian hops, focusing on herbal, floral, spicy and tangerine-like characters to create this highly drinkable 6% abv English-Style IPA.

Silverspot IPA celebrates the Oregon Silverspot butterfly which once flourished in coastal grasslands from Washington to California. Due to habitat loss, this threatened butterfly is now found only in a handful of protected areas. The Oregon Coast is home to most of these sites including nearby Mt. Hebo and Cascade Head, which can be seen from the patio of the Pelican Pub & Brewery. Oregon Silverspot butterflies depend on a unique ecosystem of coastal grasslands, with caterpillars feeding on violet leaves and butterflies drinking the nectar of flowering plants. A collaborative habitat restoration and reintroduction program is helping to increase this butterfly population.

Our first “Farm to Bottle” release is a Belgian-style farmhouse ale bursting with distinctive hop and yeast aromas. During the brew, we blended in the piloncillo and over one thousand pounds of ripe, organic California plums from the fertile orchards of Twin Girls Farm in the San Joaquin Valley. The plums add a subtle yet bright and fruity character to the beer. Next, we dosed the beer with generous helpings of Cascade and Amarillo hops.

Whenever Dogfish Head President Sam Calagione and his neighborhood friends gather for drinks, they give each other a big ol' man-hug and order a round of 60 Minute IPA. A few years ago, Sam also ordered a glass of his favorite red wine and poured a little into each pint of 60 Minute. They all dug the combination of fruity complexity and pungent hoppiness, and the blend became a beloved tradition.

Sixty-One captures that tradition in a bottle and marries two Dogfish Head innovations: beer/wine hybrids -- which Dogfish has focused on for well over a decade with beers like Midas Touch and Raison D'être -- and continually-hopped IPAs.

The name Sixty-One is a reminder that this beer is Dogfish Head’s best-selling 60 Minute IPA plus one new ingredient: syrah grape must from California. The label, painted by Sam, is a twist on a typical watercolor. Rather than using water, Sam mixed the green pigment with beer and the red pigment with wine.

I came to appreciate the grapefruit and mango that Citra brought to my palate. Suddenly, I looked for complexity over simplicity, taste over the lack thereof. I felt smarter, younger and I stopped buying processed cheese. But things changed when I realized I couldn’t drink the beer at the sports bar with the guys after hockey. They started calling me hurtful names like “beer snob” and “Mr. Fancy”. What would I drink at weddings? Baseball games? Or even a visit to the Old Man’s place? And WTF was I going to do with all my frozen beer mugs? My wife left. My dog ran away. My name is Garnett and I’m addicted to Citra.

This is apparently a reference to the FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE, which I gather is a popular… Israeli metal band? I’m not very hip.

When we get a chance to make a new hoppy beer we just get happy and start figuring out what we want to do. For a beer called “White Label” we immediately decided that this would obviously be a “white” IPA – but no spices or orange peels, clean and neutral yeast. The white in this IIPA is from using a combination of wheat and rye which leave a cool protein haze.

So OK– what next?

We felt like this was a good opportunity to lean on some of our more tropical and floral hops, so we built the recipe around a variety of new-fangled German and New Zealand hops, as well as Amarillo, a favorite US variety that features dankly citric overtones. These aromatic elements go great with the dark tangerine notes of the Bavaria Mandarina, and the floral tropicality of NZ Motueka. The elements add up to a really neat combination of fruits and flowers and a really nice lot of Maui Wowie (you know what I mean).

But there's another reason we brewed this beer, one that's closer to our home and hearts. Hopheads. 

Ten years ago we brewed our first batch of Shoals Pale Ale, our American interpretation of the traditional British ESB (Extra Special Bitter) style. At the time, it was widely considered to be darned hoppy. However, a funny thing happened over the last decade - our Shoals Pale Ale didn't change; beer lovers did, and we started to hear more and more: “Why don't you guys make a really hoppy beer?”

You could say, then, that Smuttynose IPA is a physical salute to the glory of the American hop grower. The citrusy hop flavor coming from a mixture of Simcoe and Santiams is pleasantly balanced by a smooth bitterness from the Amarillo hops. The beer itself is light bodied and crisp with a golden color that will throw a slight haze, as we bottle it unfiltered.

However, when it comes to the Stone Anniversary Ales, it's all us. Yet, it is indeed still a collaboration with great creative brewers (if we do say so ourselves). We're talking about our own brewing team, of course. And while some of our beers, anniversary and otherwise, have been designed by a single person, the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA was definitely a team effort.

This year our brewing team was inspired by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it's a Double IPA (can you really say you're surprised?), but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let's-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction variety, we've brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount of rye malt we used isn't quite enough to warrant the appellation ""Rye IPA,"" but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix, and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle lemon.",Snifter,85.0,N,Stone 16th Anniversary IPA,1.06,10

It was there that John J. first discovered the lingonberry, a tart cousin of the cranberry that originally calls the Scandinavian region home. Inspired by this discovery, the brewers decided to pay homage to the region that brought them this berry by introducing another Scandinavian staple, the hearty spruce tree.

Gran Gas, literally translated 'Spruce Goose' in Swedish, was brewed with 220 pounds of hand-picked spruce tips from Colorado, giving the beer a strong piney aroma with a hint of melon. The herbal character of the fresh spruce tips are complemented by the addition of a spicy Belgian yeast.

Baltic Porters are the stronger lager fermented cousin of the classic London Porter.

Toffee and milk chocolate dominate the flavor with subtle hints of dried fruit. One month of aging in Bourbon Barrels imparted a layer of vanilla and oak.

We first developed this beer in 2007. Our first attempted batch of beer at the 2nd street location was a Baltic Porter. What we ended up with became known as “Shake Down Nut Brown”. You can guess what went wrong from there… But, so many things right! Every year that has gone by, the beer has gotten a little bit stronger, in flavor and alcohol.

We use a black malt for the dark rich color and an extra special malt for the dried fruit flavors. Baltic Porters are fermented cold with a lager yeast. That long slow maturation creates a smooth flavor profile. The anticipation of the bourbon barrel aging it the most exciting part of this brew process.

The Saison style originated in the France/Belgian border region of Wallonia. Saison is not a single style, but more a family of beers. They were originally made in small farmhouse breweries and could vary greatly in color & flavor from farm to farm. The word “saison” means “season” in French and Saison beers were usually brewed seasonally and used as payment & fortification for seasonal farm laborers known as “saisonnaires”. Many of the original Saison beers were produced in conditions that allowed wild yeasts to colonize them and impart flavors. These Brettanomyces yeasts are now being used by modern brewers to help replicate some of the flavors of the past.

THE STORY: As the story goes, India Pale Ale was a big, hoppy beer designed to survive passage in a ship's hold all the way to India. Eagle Harbor is the bay that Downtown Winslow adjoins and the location of the ferry terminal. Interestingly, Winslow was not the main settlement on the island for much of its history. Searching for a new harbor to build ever larger ships, in 1903 the Hall Brothers Shipyard relocated from Port Blakely to Eagle Harbor. The tiny settlement of Madrone was then renamed Winslow, after the deceased Winslow Hall. Eagle Harbor IPA is named for that fading dream of enormous five-masted schooners, sailing to distant shores.",Pint,60.0,N,Eagle Harbor IPA,1.06,6

When one sees a beer with a darker complexion these days, more often than not it’s a porter or a stout. But looks can be deceiving. There exists a style older than both and generally less well known; the schwarzbier, which literally translates to “Black Beer.” Unlike its dark cousins which are ales hailing from Britain, schwarzbier comes from Germany and uses a bottom fermenting lager yeast.  Samuel Adams Black Lager is brewed in the tradition of the latter.

Nose: Mild spice & herb from the hops, fresh bread
Palate: A light crisp start transitions into a subtle soft fruit taste with biscuit and bread notes, finishing like it started, light and crisp.
Other Notes:
By style this beer is a special bitter, meaning that the alcohol (4.2%) is higher than a traditional bitter (3.5-4%). Suffolk St. is a light, approachable craft brew that would be very well suited to people unused to craft beers, or who might be intimidated by a craft brew menu, and serves as a good gateway to introduce new people to craft. It would also be well suited to business lunches as it is relatively low in alcohol. Although bitter by style, bitters are actually not overly bitter: the name is a historical designation to differentiate the style from previously un-hopped beers.

The air seems crisper and the snow covers the landscaping like a natural gift wrapping. There’s just no other place like it. And that’s the feeling that inspired Colorado Native Winterfest. It’s our way of celebrating this special time of the year and toasting our friends in Colorado.


We began brewing Colorado Native Winterfest back in September. We begin with our prized two-row barley, custom roasted to give the beer its rich, creamy flavor. Choice Colorado-grown hops are added to create the aroma and festive taste. After brewing, we chill-lager the beer to develop its distinctive taste and crisp, clean finish.  Happy Holidays from all of us at the AC Golden Brewing Company.


There are a lot of seasonal beers to choose from, but there’s only one that is brewed with 100% Colorado ingredients: barley grown in the San Luis Valley, Colorado-grown hops, Rocky Mountain water and the oldest variety of brewing yeast in the state. The majority of the barley and hops used to brew other Colorado beers comes from out-of-state.


By using only Colorado-grown barley and hops we are supporting the Colorado agriculture community. Our bottles are made in Wheat Ridge, our cans are made in Golden and we do not sell our beer outside of the state: this adds up to a smaller carbon footprint and a great tasting all Colorado beer.

We came up with a base beer that is an oatmeal brown ale made with an addition of milk sugar.  We reached out to Shannon Neffendorf at Oak Cliff Coffee Roasters and sampled some of his cold brews paired with our beer.  One coffee, in particular, played really nicely with the beer.  It's called Carmen and it's a naturally processed coffee bean from a farm in Panama.  The coffee was personally delivered to us, and ground fresh at the brewery, just before we made a 1 pound per barrel cold infusion of our own.  We let it brew for 24 hours before we add the cold infusion during transfer from fermentation vessel to brite tank.  Not only is Oak Cliff Coffee Ale a great showcase of two local businesses who are highly dedicated to their craft, it also showcases the possibilities and importance of Direct Trade Coffee.",Mug,33.0,N,Oak Cliff Coffee Ale,1.078,27

Suddenly a British Navy sloop surprised them. The drunken pirates hid below deck, leaving Captain Jack’s mistresses Anne Bonney and Mary Read to defend the ship. The women shared a reputation as “fierce hell cats,” but the British Navy eventually overtook the pirate ship. Captain Jack and the pirates were sentenced to hang. Anne visited her lover in his cell before his execution, and instead of loving words her scathing comments live on throughout history, “Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang’d like a dog.” Their legacy inspired us to brew an equally ferocious Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed with pirate rum spices.

The herbal, woodsy, and ripe citrus character of the juniper enlivens a sturdy and smooth malt backbone for a fresh and flavorful brew.

For us, the legend of this sahti goes way beyond its Nordic roots.  It’s been a labor of love, or at one time some may have said hopeless pursuit, among a few of our brewers.  For almost 8 years we’ve been tinkering with it, from experimenting with its traditional, if rudimentary, technique of brewing with full juniper branches to trying variations of berries, malts, and rye.

4359,5.3,Available year round as a staple beer.,"Another German beer that emerged after the availability of lighter colored malts, Kölsch is one of Germany's newest beer styles. Originating in Cologne (Köln in German, both the dialect spoken and a person hailing from that city are called 'Kölsch'), Kölsch is a modern descendant of the Medieval Rhenish Ale brewed throughout the region north of Munich, a distinction it shares with the nearby Dusseldörf Alt (you will hear more about this style in the near future). As demand for light colored beers grew, Cologne's brewers first developed a beer brewed mostly with wheat, quite similar to the German Weisse, called 'Keutebier'. Probably similar to a Belgian Wit, but lacking that beer's spices, Keutebier dominated brewing production in Cologne for almost 300 years. It wasn't until the 19th century that wheat started to disappear from the recipe, gradually replaced by Pilsner, until Keutebier had morphed into the modern Kölsch. 1906 is generally credited as the year modern Kölsch was first brewed by the Sünner Brewery. This new beer's popularity grew quickly, inspiring many brewers throughout the area to brew something similar. In 1946, the first agreement was signed by participating brewers that defined Kölsch. Throughout a turbulent history, many more agreements and legal battles have been waged until Kölsch was finally recognized by the EU with regional protections similar to those enjoyed by wine. Today a true Kölsch is brewed only in Cologne or the immediate area, but beers inspired by Kölsch are brewed all over the world. Clandestine's 'Kölsch I Can' is brewed with the same spirit as its German cousins: it is a subtle, malty, clean, crisp ale that has been lagered to reach peak flavors. Respectful of tradition, this beer is brewed only with German malts and hops. Soft water is used to push the malt flavors to the forefront of this still delicate beer.

While living in Germany during the 1990’s John fell in love with this amazing beer. There are few things more enjoyable than standing outside a historic brewpub on a warm summer evening in Düsseldorf’s Altstadt (“old city”), drinking a cold, refreshing Altbier as the sun sets over the Rhein river.

Alt (pronounced ‘Aahlt’) literally means “old” in German, as in “old school.” In other words, it’s beer the old fashioned way.  Technically, OMB Copper is an ale due to the type of yeast it’s made from (Obergärig or top fermenting yeast).  However, a long time ago the folks in Düsseldorf learned that by lagering their Alt for several weeks after primary fermentation they could produce a full-flavored, yet smoother and more refreshing beer. OMB uses authentic ingredients in our Copper Altbier, including expensive (but worth it) noble Bavarian hops. We also adhere to traditional, time consuming, costly decoction brewing techniques to produce this copper hued, amazingly satisfying “lagered ale.”",Stange,31.0,N,OMB Copper,1.048,12

According to German criteria for a true pilsener, however, the vast majority of them would be unrecognizable as such. By this definition, a pilsener is a lager beer with a light golden color (5-8 color units by European Brewers' Convention standards), a specific gravity in the 11.5-12.5% Plato range, and a hops content of at least 28 EBUs (European Bitter Units). Most so-called domestic ""pilseners"" fall far short in these categories; Bayern Pilsener easily meets all three (6 color units, 12% Plato, 34 EBUs).

 What does all this technical jargon mean? It means you have purchased one of the very few authenic pilseners brewed in America. Reward yourself by enjoying this beer the way it was meant to be served: pour your cold Bayern Pilsener, in two or three slow steps, into the center of your glass (a fluted or ""tulip"" glass works best). The thick creamy head (the German term for this is ""crown"") and you have just created the mark of a classic Bavarian pilsener.

Followed with additional dry hopping in the fermenter, the end result is a big, well-balanced West Coast-style IPA with terrific hop flavor and aroma.",,60.0,N,IPA,1.06,10

The simplicity of the mash and the hop additions make the brewing process very easy going, that is, until we get to the dry hopping process. Timing the dry hopping can be tricky.

Where did we come up with this name? Back in the year 2000, our friend, Vic Kralj, who owns the Bistro in Hayward, California, decided to have his first ever Double IPA festival. Vic invited 10 breweries, 6 of whom (including us) had to brew something special for him since we had nothing that would fall under this style category. Vinnie had made a Double IPA at Blind Pig in 1994, but was not brewing one at Russian River Brewing at the time. He had an idea for the recipe, but not a name. After much research in beer books, brainstorming, and deliberation, we came up with ""Pliny the Elder"". Pliny, the man, lived in the first century- 23 to 79 A.D. According to our brewing references, he and his contemporaries either created the botanical name or at least wrote about Lupus Salictarius, or hops, currently known as Humulus Lupulus. That was a very early reference to an important part of any Double IPA! Pliny the beer has now become one of our flagship brews!
 
Pliny the Elder was immortalized by his nephew, Pliny the Younger, who wrote about his uncle succumbing to ash and smoke during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. while rescuing people. Cheers to the scholar, historian, officer, writer, and Roman Naturalist- Pliny the Elder!

As early as 1849, India Pale Ale - prepared by British brewers for export to India by adding dry hops to barrels of hoppy ale - was also heading west, from England around the Horn to San Francisco. Thirsty ‘49ers savored the best imported IPAs, but it wasn’t until 1975 that Anchor, Americas' original craft brewery, pioneered the revival of dry-hopped handmade ales. Now, that tradition fast-forwards to an adventurous new brew: Anchor IPA™.

Anchor IPA™ is made with 2-row barley malt and fresh whole-cone hops, its bright amber color, distinctively complex aroma, spiky bitterness, malty depth, and clean finish unite to create a uniquely flavorful, memorable, and timeless craft IPA.

The elephant you see on Anchor IPA™ was hand-drawn by our label artist, James Stitt. To ""see the elephant"" was a popular 19th-century expression that originated with a tale that predates the California Gold Rush.

There once lived a farmer who had heard of elephants but had never seen one. He longed for the day when he might catch a glimpse of this rare, exotic creature. When the circus came to town, he loaded his wagon with fresh produce and headed to market. On the way, just as he'd hoped, he came across the circus parade, nobly led by an enormous elephant. The farmer was ecstatic, but his horses were terrified. They reared and bucked, overturning his wagon and scattering its precious contents in the road. ""I don’t give a hoot,"" exclaimed the farmer. ""I have seen the elephant!""

The elephant became the universal symbol of the Gold Rush, as evidenced by the journals, letters, and sketchbooks of the forty-niners. Whether or not they struck it rich in the diggings, those plucky pioneers would forever treasure their California adventure as the defining moment of their lives.

For the eventual full production batch, this meant 40 pounds of thoroughly flat-top cooked bacon, as well as bacon-grease-soaked wood chips, going into the fermenter. Kegging from the bottom of the tank allowed us to leave the fat behind, resulting in a decadent, drinkable porter with a porky soul.

Pilsners are lager beers, meaning they are brewed with bottom fermenting yeast, and then aged or lagered in cold conditioning tanks.

Since their introduction, pilsners have become the most popular style of beer in the world. At Uinta, we have replicated a true old world pilsner by using the finest imported Saaz hops and then aging this golden lager for nearly a month. The aging process creates a smooth, mellow flavor that gives it a remarkable drinkability. Enjoy the delicate balance between the flowery hops and the assertive malt flavors.

Where did the name come from? Uinta embraced the concept of renewable energy in 2001 by committing to 100% wind powered energy. The name Blue Sky Pilsner stems from that commitment.

The name of the brewer was George Bentel. His house is still standing in New Harmony.  The Harmonist brewer and cooper, George Bentel, was born November 3, 1781 in Iptingen, the same village in the Swabian kingdom of Württemberg where George Rapp was born.  Bentel lived at the northeast corner of Brewery and Grainery streets, where his house remains today, as upright as when Indiana's first brewer marched out to make his beer almost two centuries ago.
The German utopian communalists in New Harmony were Indiana's first significant brewers. Beginning in 1816, the Harmonists eventually brewed enough to sell all the way up to what is now West Virginia and down into lower Illinois. From the historical record, it appears the Harmonists brewed a porter-like dark beer. It must have been pretty good beer: An educated German, Ferdinand Ernst, stopped in New Harmony during his journey through the frontier region. “They served me a stein of beer,” Ernst wrote, “and I was not a little astonished to find here a genuine, real Bamberg beer.” He gushed that the Harmonists “must be happiest people of entire Christiandom.” A Louisville agent for the Harmonists reported, “Mr. Breeden, the most celebrated porter seller in the place says the strongest part of it would almost pass for porter and is the best beer he has ever seen in this country…",Pint,22.7,N,Harmonie Dark Lager,1.04,18
